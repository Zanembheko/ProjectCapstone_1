# ProjectCapstone_1

** Python 3.8.0 **

## Purpose of the project

A python program that calculate a value of a bond or investment at an end of a certain period

If client chooses the investment they are going to be asked if it's a simple or compound interest,

The user will be requested to enter the money they are supposed to invested and the period

The user will requested to input the interest rate in percentage

if the user chose the bond

The user should be requested to enter the present value of the house or property, enter the interest rate and the period they are supposed to pay



##formulas to be 

Interest formula:
Simple interest rate is calculated as follows: A = P(1 + r * t)
The Python equivalent is very similar: A =P*(1+r*t)
Compound interest rate is calculated as follows: A = P(1 + r) ^ t
The Python equivalent is slightly different: A = P* math.pow((1+r),t)
In the formulae above:
 ‘r’ below is the interest entered above divided by 100, e.g. if 8% is
entered, then r is 0.08.
‘P’ is the amount that the user deposits.
‘t’ is the number of years that the money is being invested for.
